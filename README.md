# Model Evaluation Assignment

This evaluates five models of subaru price. The data used to evaluate the model is in the
file `price_estimates.txt`, which holds estimated prices for all data in the test
data set. 

The goal is to evaluate the models and understand their performance a bit. Specifically,

* Compare the models with some of our measures of accuracy. Does one model stand out?
* In the above, use one measure of accuracy that is not `rmse`, `rsq`, `mae`, or `mape` and 
  give a brief description of what it is. 
* What would you consider the two best models? 
* For the best and second-best models, are there certain parts of the data space 
  where they seem to do worse? This doesn't need to be a super deep dive, but 
  consider their performance on 
    * Cars of different models
    * Cars of different ages
    * Cars of different mileages
